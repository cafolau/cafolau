Last Friday, I made one final drive from Arizona up to Utah before my move to Germany. The landscapes were beautiful. I found myself reflecting on previous times I'd made the trip, which got me thinking about how I've changed in the time I've lived in Arizona. Realizing I'd grown so much in only two years brought me to further reflection and an insight: for the past eight years, I've averaged reinventing myself every 16 months.

Once after graduating high school and moving to Provo to attend BYU. Again to go on my mission to Germany. A third time returning from my mission. A fourth time coming out. A fifth time graduating from BYU and moving to Arizona. And now a sixth time moving back to Germany for grad school.

Realizing this I asked myself: "When will I become me? When will I stop reinventing? Does one ever stop reinventing? Am I truly a different person after each of these invterventions?"

For now, I press forward, shaping my future as I will. But I wonder if I will ever truly feel that I am the same Christian that moved to BYU in 2015, that went on a mission in 2016, returned in 2018, came out in 2021, and graduated that same year. Are those past selves still within me? Are they me? Could today's me pull off the feats of those past selves? Could those past selves survive the pressures and fires that my present self shrugs off as the daily grind? Given the opportunity to encounter my past selves, would we recognize each other?
