What if Arizona is more beautiful than I thought?


I’m sitting in a Panera Bread, the one near Chandler Fashion place mall. Next door is my favorite Target, and behind that one of the Costcos I most often visit. I wanted to listen to Taylor Swift’s _1989_, so I picked up where I left off at _Wonderland_. Then, _You Are In Love_ came on. I’m working on the words to articulate how that song makes me feel. It’s like a peace, like a coming home, like a contentment I’d happily allow to go on without self-destructing it myself. Usually, I listen to it and imagine what it’d be like to be in love, to have a marriage, to have a partner. But this afternoon, it’s lead me to reflection on my last two years living in Arizona.

I never truly meant to come here. After my summer 2020 internship, my company gave me a job offer, which I promptly accepted. The world was an uncertain, dark place for me at that time. Both the pandemic and my struggle with my orientation made the future clouded, a terrible leet down after a blissful summer that can only be described as the kiss of sun’s rays dancing across my face while I bask in their warmth, laying in the grass of a quiet park. Things became so dark for me in fall 2020, a job in Arizona was a sure bet. And so I left everyone and everything I knew—again—and moved to what I saw as a holding pattern while I figured my real life out.

For a long time, I never really invested in building a life here. I’d always meant to get out of Arizona within a few years. At the very least I’d move back to my friends and family in Utah, maybe around Salt Lake. I never really changed that policy, though I perhaps evolved it. Despite seeing Arizona as a stepping stone, I don’t feel like these two years have been a waste. I did imagine I’d feel more ready to find a relationship by the time I left. I don’t. But there are some other ways I think I’ve grown.

Moving from my very walkable college campus lifestyle, I have gained a lot of weight. But I think maybe I’m better at not hating my body? Once in a while, I see pictures of me from my time at BYU and realize I was hot, even though I didn’t feel like it at the time and still don’t now. I’ve learned not to be aware of my new dimensions in a way that drives me mad. I can notice the weight of my belly shift as I roll over in bed and remind myself of all the hardships, fears, and unknowns my body has carried me through and appreciate it. I feel far from beautiful, but I have learned in Arizona I deserve to treat my body with more kindness.

Professionally, I think I’ve grown a lot as well, though mostly since joining my current team in March. 2020 me would not have realized I could guide a team of individuals more experienced than me in a project. Now I realize I can contribute to that group. I’ve also gained a reassurance that I can care for myself economically. I’ve accepted that I am a worthwhile hire, that I can earn enough to live in a certain kind of frugal comfort (I still can’t afford an apartment on my own in the Phoenix area while meeting other important financial goals). I’ve saved enough to finance a master’s program in Berlin twice over while eliminating the debt from my car. In Arizona, I’ve learned to fear the economic future less.

My relationship with my parents has also evolved, though perhaps in part thanks to my mother’s cancer. I’ve been able to recognize that while I was treated with unacceptable bullying during childhood, my parents are largely different in their behavior to me now. I can hold that hurt and how it affects me still, while also remaining cordial with my parents. I’m still not sure I feel about my parents how I would if they’d built me up as a child, rather than tearing me down. But I can at least mentally isolate the first 18 years of my relationship with them when interacting with them now. I’ve accepted that they’ll never own what they did to me, and perhaps I’ll never be able to trust them the way my brothers can. But it hurts a lot less now. When I told them I got into grad school in Germany, I even felt like they were genuinely proud of me. And not in a backhanded sort of way. In Arizona, I’ve learned to fear and resent my parents less.

There are things I’m going to miss here. Evening walks around Tumbleweed park—the largest publicly accessible grassy area near my home. Getting a drink at Swig, picking up a chicken bake, and listening to Strangerville in the parking lot of Costco. Drives to visit friends in Utah are opportunities to disconnect, reflect, and revel in whatever moods my Spotify playlists brings me. Going to downtown Gilbert to walk the farmer’s market and visit new restaurants with friends. The way I love to hate the stinky desert smell that comes with rain here. Hanging with the social circles I have from church outside a church setting (to be honest, I never felt truly at home in the ward here. Though I’m not sure I’ll ever feel that again after coming out to myself). Watching planes at the Chandler Municipal or Mesa Falcon Field airports. I really like my roommates Jacob and Fred, I’ll miss them. Going to Panera to have some place to hang out that’s air-conditioned, but also not my house and not work. Occasionally going out on drives, getting a bit lost, then recognizing the surroundings months later when I’m going somewhere new on purpose. Despite my best efforts, Arizona has things I’m going to miss.

Arizona was always meant to be a stepping stone, a springboard into the bigger, "realer“ life I’d build for myself after gaining some economic stability. It has been that, and it has been more. I did not anticipate being able to reflect on my time here with any sense of nostalgia, a respectful appreciation for what Arizona has been for me, or a melancholic excitement for the future ahead of me. I am not yet everything I will become, everything I want to be. I am still building my life, but I am also living it.
