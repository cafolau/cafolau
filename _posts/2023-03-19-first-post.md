"Oh my gosh, how are you? Crazy to see you all the way out here. Wasn't that traffic a nightmare? Gosh, how many years has it been?"

What if you could greet yourself like a close friend from college? A friend you love and parted amicably with in order to pursue the next phases of your lives. Nothing dramatic went down—there was no fighting, no pushing other away. You called regularly, always eager to hear what they were up to, felt your heart swell with pride as you heard about the life they were building for themselves. Eventually those calls petered out in frequency as your new lives expanded to occupy ever more of your bandwidth. After years, they're unexpectedly standing in front of you again, greeting you with warmth and affection as if it's been no time at all. 


You've both got some time to kill, so you get dinner at your favorite restaurant from late nights in school. Familiar faces and familiar places, you exchange anecdotes of professional conquest, personal challenges, and questions pondered. Perhaps a couple hours pass and you realize this conversation isn't just a waystation on your journey, but a touchstone connecting you with a dormant part of youself, an identity you had inadvertantly come to believe was some separate version of you. 

College friend or not, I hope time travel and/or cloning never exist such that I encounter myself in the third person. The uncanny valley has good reason to exist. But I do want to learn empathizing with, listening to, and encouraging myself like I have towards my friends. And I think having some writings that force me to reflect on and share experiences will help. After a few years of tectonic life shifts brought to a head by the pandemic, I hope to reconnect with myself so that I can more authentically connect with others—you too!

It's so nice to see you!
