Today, I learned Panera is discontinuing its Charged Lemonade beverages. And I teared up at the news.

When I moved to Arizona in July 2021, I sought out places to be that weren't my house or workplace and had air conditioning. It was during that phase that I discovered the Valley was dotted with Panera Bread cafes. I had loved Panera as a kid, but there were only a few located far from my hometown. Panera was a special treat, something we could do for a birthday or a class trip. While I studied in Utah, there were no Paneras despite a plethora of other sandwich shops to choose from. Panera had air conditioning, WiFi, a fun menu, and felt like a childhood treat.

I spent a lot of time and money going to Panera over the next two years of living in Arizona. Sometimes I just ate and left to run other errands. Often I combined it with a trip to Trader Joe's next door. I'd call friends and family or catch up on correspondence with loved ones. I'd journal about my day. I applied to jobs. I watched shows. I applied to grad school in Germany. I pondered what kind of life I wanted to live. I asked myself questions like, "Will anybody ever love me?"

One day they had new lemonades-and they were caffeinated! Thinking they would have caffeine levels similar to a Dr. Pepper, I drank two at dinner at 6 PM during the work week. At 4 AM, I googled and realized just how caffeinated the lemonades were.  So I stopped drinking them. For a long time. Until work got really busy. And there were more people counting on me to be "on" when I got into the office. I was already a fun beverage girly, so Panera Charged Lemonades were one resource I used to make sure I could show up for people the way I wanted to. I only drank them a few times a week, and I could make it into a fun quirky part of my work personality.

Living in Germany is the fullfilment of dreams over 8 years in the making. Doing graduate school to reach greater career opportunities follows the charge I bear from the legacy of immigration established through intense sacrifice and self-discipline by my father and grandparents. I am, in principle, becoming everything I ever wanted to be.

But I have missed so much back home. My brother's wedding during my school semester. Multiple rounds of chemo and surgeries for my mother's ovarian cancer. Family trips. My best friend's dating woes and triumphs. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Spa days. Long weekends. RHOSLC marathons. Hikes. Campouts. Farmer's markets. Brunches.

Now I'm missing the death of Panera's Charged Lemonades. It shouldn't be the straw that breaks the camel's back. And it won't be-this camel has borne heavier burdens.  But on this Wednesday night, it is enough to cause bittersweet reflection. I get to live out a goal I've pursued for nearly a decade and almost all my adult life. And I am so immensely grateful to have people I miss whose lives I still want to be part of. But for all the gratitude, I still miss them.
