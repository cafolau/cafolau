Today, I learned that Trinity Health is a Qualtrics customer. That's the same health system where my mom received her cancer care. They also operate the St. Joseph Mercy Hospital where she passed. It also happens to be where my dad went for all three of his heart attacks (which truly isn't what's affecting me now).



I'm writing this in one of the office phone booths. I came here because I could feel the grief welling up, and I wanted to let it. I didn't spend time at Trinity other than last February, when I went with mom to her appointments. But in reading their name today, I was transported back to those sacred halls and hallowed spaces. Back to a time where my belief that my mother could make it remained undefiled.

A time where I could have prepared us for what was coming, if only I'd known. Where I, willing supplicant, could have savored every morsel of time granted by whatever fickle—or perhaps merciful?—gods may be. When I could've asked her questions. When I could've asked her how to be.

I would have preserved for all ages her stories, her voice, and her wisdom in the amber of the written word, video recording, and stone tablet. The traces of her would be more than vulnerable photo albums on a shelf and her blood that runs heavy in my veins. The flowers of her strength and the thorns of her sacrifices alike would lay pressed between the pages of memory. I would have stood before the judgement seat of God and said, "Behold [my] mother."[^1]

Instead, I sit in the middle of five booths near the Yangtze River (an incredibly pretentious name for a conference room). I answer Slack messages and rail against Fate, knowing she can withstand anything I throw at her like a parent picking up a distraught, limb-swinging toddler off the floor. I find it cathartic and believe I am owed this reprieve.

It is awesome[^2] to know that my grief is deeper and more beautiful than anyone else's and that my mother's life was more meaningful than anyone else's. It is humbling to know that my sorrow and her loss are merely part of humanity's universal inheritance. And when I wrap my arms around these ostensibly contrary truths with the desperation of a sailor clinging to flotsam, it is healing.
