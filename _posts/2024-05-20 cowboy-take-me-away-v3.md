When I turned 26, I had just moved to Germany to start grad school after a successful two years of working full time in supplier development at a Fortune 100 company. When my mother turned 26, she was managing an apartment complex in Salt Lake City, Utah after having worked as a medical assistant, LDS missionary, and bank teller. Her need to survive after being kicked out at 18 and told to never return meant she was taking community college classes, still working towards a degree which her resources had allowed her to pursue only sporadically over the preceeding eight years. But things were stable. My mother was 26, living in Salt Lake, managing an apartment complex, and building a life.


>"I wanna touch the earth"

Despite having little to no contact to her biological father growing up, my mother did have something of a reconciliatory phase with him. He offered to pay for her training as a medical assitant in Provo, Utah. After the withdrawal deadline passed and the fees were due, he withdrew his offer. My mother was left on the hook for money she couldn't afford. She never spoke to him again, allowing him to occupy as much space in her life as he desired.

Early in her college career, my mother broke up with her boyfriend. With nobody to guide her through that youthful hearbtreak, she got a bad exam grade in her grief and lost a scholarship crucial to her being able to support herself with no family to help her.

When my mother was 16, she got into an argument with her mother. She pointed out that she was 16 and was too large to spank anymore. In response, her 4' 10" mother grabbed her by the throat and choked her to the ground, ordering her to never disrespect her again. This is the same woman who sent my mother away to live with my great-grandmother after having two more kids with an alcoholic Vietnam vet, who perceived my mother as a burden too great for his support in light of his 'actual' children's needs. And while my mother recalled her grandmother fondly, she also recalled that same grandmother's disbelief when my mother confided in her about being raped.

When my mother was 11, her mother got married to that alcoholic Vietnam vet, who beat my mom. He beat her harder when she'd try to protect her sister. Around this time, her uncle (son of aforementioned grandmother) began repeatedly raping her and threatening to rape and kill her sister if she ever told anyone. The paragon of an eldest daughter's tragedy, she remained silent. As an adult she learned her sister was raped by the same man.

At birth, my mother was named Kathrin Lorraine by her father after two flight attendants he had lived with, neither of whom were my grandmother. He filled out the birth certificate behind my grandmother's back despite agreeing to name her Christine. When my mother was four years old, he would abandon her, her sister, and her mother, taking the car that had been paid off with him and saddling them with the other car's payments and no income. It was only later that year that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act would allow my grandmother to get her own bank account. Despite having been sealed a total of 6 times to different wives in temples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including several marriages before my mother's 18th birthday, he paid not a single dime of child support during all my mother's upbringing.

>"Cowboy take me away (...) Set me free, oh I pray"

So, when my mother was 26, she was managing an apartment complex in Salt Lake City. Two tenants-my aunt and uncle-introduced her to my father. Feeling prompted by the Spirit, they were engaged. He was a Navy veteran, had a degree in electrical engineering, and worked a salaried fedeeral government job with a pension. And the journals say they had a whirlwind romance. Met in May and married in October. I was born a month before their first anniversary.

Here, stories end and memories begin.

My mother and I have a complicated relationship. Or at least, I know I see it as complicated. On the one hand, she was the parent I was naturally aligned with. We shared an interest in reading. She introduced me to country music and _The Chicks_. We were partners in maintaining the household. Thankfully, I have my eyebrows from her-my father barely has any. Speaking of him, we'd both turn to each other after being berated by him when we misjduged his fickle moods. After one particularly nasty shouting session before Wednesday night youth activities, she took me shopping instead of making me go to church (the shopping was not the point, the time and space before having to pretend everything was okay in front of the ward was). I'm told she and I have similar cheekbones, though honestly I don't fully understand what that means. She agrees with me that health insurance companies shouldn't be allowed to dictate what medications we take. We sign our last name the same way. I use the same hair product she used for the last 20 years.

On the other hand, my mother often stood with my father when he'd emotionally abuse me. Her responses focused on how my father really truly did love me and in what ways I should change my behavior to prevent his outbursts. I implcitily learned that love was how he treated me, which of course meant he spoke truth. She and my father were raging, proud homophobes during my childhood, and I still sense that she'd made exceptions to her beliefs for me more than having really changed them. She slandered me as a radical leftist about once a year for saying things like, "It'd be great if we could put in some public transport. It'd reduce traffic at peak hours." When I mentioned I was worried some politicians may try to restrict queer (my) rights based on statements they've made about their intentions, she told me I shouldn't worry because gays are one of the most protected classes of America. 

But when I hear _The Chicks_ frontwoman Natalie Maines sing, "I wanna touch the earth, I wanna break it in my hands (...) I wanna walk and not run, I wanna skip and not fall (...) Cowboy take me away, Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue, Set me free, oh I pray" I think of my mother, at 4, abandoned. I think of my mother, at 11, trying to protect her sister. I think of my mother, at 16, throat bruised. I think of my mother, at 18, abandoned _again_. I think of my mother, heartbroken for the first time, wondering how she could afford to stay alive. I think of my mother, betrayed by her father for the final time.

I think of my mother, at 26, living in Salt Lake, managing an apartment complex, and engaged to my father. I think of the terrors she'd overcome. I think of how her family failed and endangered her. I think about how she stood before a future in which finally, she could belong to a family. In which she could touch the earth. In which she could break it in her hands. In which she could walk, and not run. In which she could skip and not fall. I think of what it must've been like to have spent those years alone and to _know_ she would not be alone anymore.

And I understand her and her choices better. And I feel the weight of her dreams on my shoulders. And a duty to honor that legacy. A desire to honor that legacy. Does that make our relationship less complicated? No. But to be human is to contradict. To love is to see another's contradictions and choose to still see them.

So-here I am, at 26, without my mother. And I love her.
