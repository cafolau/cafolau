In honor of Heartstopper's season two premier, here's some thoughts I gathered on Heartstopper's personal impact on me last year when I'd first watched season one.


After watching season one of Hearstopper twice last week, I'm now coming off the emotional high I felt through watching Nick and Charlie’s story. This beautiful series touched me, bringing me new hope and perhaps new healing that I’m not sure I’ve ever felt before. I’m so grateful to Alice Oseman for creating this story and sharing it with us. Heartstopper has helped me to more productively manage and understand my emotions, become more secure in my orientation, recognize and heal emotional pain from growing up, and better apply self-compassion.

#Living vicariously, but not really
I felt so much joy watching Heartstopper. And I realized today that I was drawing those feelings vicariously through Nick and Charlie as their relationship developed, they came into themselves (particularly Nick who had to confront his orientation for the first time), and they built their relationship together. I realized that part of why I watched it again so soon was to remain on that emotional high of experiencing through Nick and Charlie the kind of relationship I wish I’d had at that age and that I still want.

Only yesterday did I realize that those warm feelings would have to give way to some emptiness (not that it’s a new thing, I just get surprised every time). I’d felt it already while watching--joy that kids these days would have better representation, some sadness that I didn’t and wondering what might’ve been if I’d had. It’s not a hopeless or debilitating emptiness though. It feels like an appropriately solemn recognition of missed opportunities. But it does leave me wondering questions like, “If I had an opportunity for that loving, equal kind of partnership right now, would I be ready to let such love in? What does it even mean to let love/someone into my heart? How can I be ready for such an opportunity?”

#“It’s always been boys.”

Growing up, I’d often lay in bed at night daydreaming scenarios with fictional characters to escape my life. I’d imagine Artemis Fowl as my protective older brother whom I could lean on, Tom Riddle as a close friend who betrayed me when he became Voldemort, or Alex Rider as my best friend and the spy looking out for me. When I was particularly young, I even dreamt of Christopher Robin. I realized after coming out that I wasn’t imagining these characters as brothers or friends, though that was the only language I had to articulate the ideas at the time. I was imagining them as partners.

There’s a moment in Heartstopper when Nick and Charlie are at a park, laying on a blanket side-by-side next to a fallen tree. Nick asks Charlie how/when he knew he was gay. Charlie explains that he’d known it when he was very young, “It’s always been boys.” While rewatching that scene, I realized that my daydream crush on Christopher Robin must’ve happened when I was merely 3 or 4 years old, back when I was watching Winnie the Pooh cartoons. Nothing and nobody turned me gay. It’s always been boys.

#Honoring past experiences

Social media content crushing on Kit Connor or Joe Locke makes me very uncomfortable--until I realize that the creators are likely teenagers, unlike me. While I don’t have crushes on Nick (15) and Charlie (14) themselves--even their actors Kit Connor and Joe Locke are only 18 to my 24--I can recognize a desire to have had their relationship when I was their age. I can acknowledge that my family, religious background, and environment prevented me from having that experience. And I can allow myself to grieve that.

Charlie and Nick’s relationship brings back a lot of feelings and crushes I had when I was their age. Seeing how healthily and equally invested they handle their relationship helps me to honor the feelings of love and respect and desire for emotional intimacy I’ve experienced. I can recognize them as natural and healthy, and allow myself to enjoy the memory of them. In this way, maybe I can allow my inner child to heal.

#Being nice to Nick and Charlie, being nice to myself

As an outside observer, I thought a lot about what I’d try to do and say to help Nick and Charlie if I were a character in their story. If I were, say, Charlie’s older brother, how would I help him process his relationship with Ben Hope? If my family were close friends with Nick’s, what might I say to try to help him figure out and accept his orientation? 

During my re-watch of Heartstopper, I realized that while I initially saw myself primarily as Charlie (gay kid has crush on popular jock), I could find myself during this second viewing in both Charlie and Nick:

Charlie for the reasons that he seems to believe he’s making others’ lives harder by just being in their lives, is uncertain of himself, and seems not to believe he is worthy of love. 
Nick for the reasons that he was suddenly confronted with his orientation when he A) seems to previously have not suspected not being straight and B) suddenly found himself with feelings for a male friend that he couldn’t attribute to just friendship.

Making these connections and writing this, I realized I could do for myself what I would try to do for Nick and Charlie. It was incredibly helpful to have two people external to me, to think about how I’d try to help them, to discover ways I identify with them, and then to turn that around on myself. I know some people advise talking to oneself as one would talk to a friend, but I just haven’t been able to figure that out by directly thinking about myself. By giving me characters I wanted to try to help, with whom I only later realized I felt represented by, Hearstopper helped me begin an actual mental framework for that self-compassion.

Hearstopper has given me renewed belief that I can heal from emotional trauma related to my orientation, that I can have a healthy relationship, and that I can teach myself to genuinely believe that I deserve those things. I’m also incredibly glad to know that there’s some kid out there who is like I was and gets to have this story. I’m so happy to recognize that gratitude while also being able to mourn the opportunities I didn’t have and move forward. I’ve also ordered the books and am looking forward to 1) the dopamine rush of getting a package and 2) seeing where Nick and Charlie go next.
